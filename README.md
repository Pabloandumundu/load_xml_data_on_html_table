A little javascript code that loads data from xml archive via XMLHttpRequest and put in on the web. In this case is used a table but data can be used for more; to load images for example.


An example can be seen here: [http://pabloandumundu.neocities.org/examples/load_xml_data_on_html_table/index.html](http://)

Something related to this I want to share a trick to create xml archives, that can be used by the code above, from office calc archives (in particular it runs with LibreOffice Calc).

To export to xml from LibreOffice Calc download the archive cited in https://alliages.wordpress.com/2013/09/04/libreoffice-calc-xslt-export-filter-to-xml/
(more directly the archive is here: https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B6eiQ1YkktWOUkJrbEZnRU01Mkk/edit?usp=sharing )
In Openoffice Calc go to 'tools' and select configure 'XML filters' click on open package and select the file you downloaded.
Now it is possible to export files in that works XML format exporting as 'SITEWEB XML'.
